# Spectral clustering coefficients and higher-order eigenvector centrality

This repository contains the code accompanying the work    
*A framework for second order eigenvector centralities and clustering coefficients*    
by F Arrigo, D J Higham and F Tudisco    


To run, the codes require the Sandia Lab Matlab Tensor Toolbox available at:
http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.6.html

The folder contains:   
datasets	                  - folder containing some of the datasets used in manuscript   
functions                   - folder containing some of the functions used in the code   
link_prediction_example.m   - script implementing an example of link prediction test
